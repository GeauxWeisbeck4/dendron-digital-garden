    - Object and array destructuring
    - Template literals

# Why Learn React?
1. React is very popular. As a developer, it's quite likely that you're going to work on a React project in the future. Perhaps an existing project, or maybe your team will want you to work on a brand new app based on React.
2. A lot of tooling today is built using React at the core. Popular frameworks and tools like Next.js, Gatsby, and many others use React under the hood.
3. As a frontend engineer, React is probably going to come up in a job interview.
