# What is a design system?
These are the notes from the first section of the [Design System Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/design-system)

## Style Guide and Pattern Libraries
Two deliverables of Design systems are style guides (Focuses on graphic styles like colors, fonts, and illustrations + their usage) and pattern libraries (integrates functional components and their usage)
    - Example: [Shopify's Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com/)

The fundamental purpose of a Design System is to facilitate the work of the teams. We need to define our target and understand what is already in place for who were designing the system for.

## What's inside?
1. Purpose and shared values
   - Before starting anything, it’s essential to align teams around a clear set of shared goals. It will help to build a vision and making sure everyone looks in the same direction. These goals will evolve with time and it’s normal. We just have to make sure that changes are broadly communicated.
   - Values are great ideals that guide our choices according to brand objectives
2. Design Principles: Design principles are the guiding sentences that helps the teams to reach the purpose of the product thanks to the design.

3. Brand identity & Language - Should follow strategy and objectives of brand: -colors, fonts, spaces, shapes, icons ,ilustrations, photograics animations, voice and tone, sounds
4. Components and Patterns: The compoenents are the lego blocks of design systems. They're used in sketch by designers,  and directly in code by developers. Patterns are the building instructions that will allow us to use these components in the most logical and consistent way.
5. Best Practices: Help teams to form and develop technical skills

# What kind of Design System?
There is typciall one kind of design system per team or product. We must ask:
- HOw many people will use this system?
- What is their profile and are they matuer enough on the subject
- - How many produts must we align? How many platforms? What different techs?
- What degree of consistency do we want?

# Strict or Loose?
-A strict system will have a comprehensive and detailed documentation and will be fully synchronized between design and development-

# Modular or Integrated?
-A modular system is made of interchangeable and reusable parts. It suits well for projects that have to scale quickly and that have to adapt to multiple user needs. The negative part is that it’s often more expensive to realize (because it can be difficult to make modules that can be independent while working well together). This kind of system will particularly fit large scale product as e-commerce, finance and governments websites. For a modular system, it will be very interesting to work with atomic design in mind.
-An integrated system focus on one unique context. It’s also composed of parts, but these parts will not be interchangeable. This kind of system suits products that have very few repeating parts and that need a strong and often changing Art Direction (portfolios, showcases, marketing campaigns…).

# Centralized or distributed?

-In a centralized model, one team is in charge of the System and makes it evolve. This team is here to facilitate the work of the other teams and has to be very close to them, to be sure that the System covers most of their needs.
-In a distributed model, several people of several teams are in charge of the system. The adoption of the system is quicker because everyone feels involve but it also needs team leaders that will keep an overall vision of it.

# Place your systems on a scale
