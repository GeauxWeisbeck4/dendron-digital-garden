Welcome to my Digital Garden! My name is Andrew and I create lots of websites, content, and other digital things that are all over the place. I have struggled with starting my digital garden with a simple note taking app like Dendron, until now! That is because I just recently found Dendron!

Previously I have used Notion, LogSeq and some other ones - I like them, but I didn't have one that just felt right with any of my coding tools. Well that is no longer the case! Dendron works with VS Code which is perfect for my Digital Garden! I can code and take notes at the same time.

I hope you enjoy my collection of notes here and see how they go on out to other websites, and spill out onto the universe!
