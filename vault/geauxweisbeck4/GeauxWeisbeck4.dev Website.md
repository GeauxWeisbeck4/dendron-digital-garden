# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev

This is the 2nd version of my professional developer website. The first version was pretty good - not good enough for what  need to show my skills now however. I am going to do a complete rebuild from scratch using Next.js, Storyblok CMS, Prisma, PostgreSQL and more.

  - [ ] NextJS
  - [ ] Storyblok CMS
  - [ ] Tailwind CSS (first iteration) - Then sass
- [ ] Backend
  - [ ] Supabase: Postgres DB, Auth, More
- [ ] Update Andrewweisbeck.tech
- [ ] [[andrewweisbeck.blog]] link to here
- [ ] Add Slack channel
