# Job Search
I have been searching for a job for about 10 months now and I'm getting exhausted from all the stress and poverty. Before I add more, I am going to create a "job search prayer":

*Lord, I don't need much, but Lisa and I can't take this pain anymore. I don't know why this has been such a struggle, but please let me get a simple web developer job so I can support my family. Thank you God, you are great. Amen*
